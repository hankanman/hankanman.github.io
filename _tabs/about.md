# The Blog

Been working in tech for a long time and thought it was high time I shared some of my knowledge, so here we are. I hope this is a resource you find useful and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hankanman) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebburrell/).

There will be a couple topics I will talk about here but it will often be oriented around making life easier through technology. Whether at home or work, I am always looking for ways to make things easier and more efficient. I hope you find some of the things I share here useful.

# The Man

I'm 30-something and have been working in tech for over 10 years. I have worked in a variety of roles from support to development to architecture and have worked with a variety of technologies. I am currently a Business Application Practice Lead for a Microsoft Partner in the UK. I also have 3 dogs and a guinea pig at home that keep me company through long development days!

# The Myth

I can control things with my mind

# The Legend

I once ate an entire KFC family bucket meal in one sitting (It was my birthday and I was a little drunk)
